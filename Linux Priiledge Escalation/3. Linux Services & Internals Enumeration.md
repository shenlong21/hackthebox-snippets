## Try to answer these questions:
 - What services and applications are installed?
 - What services are running?
 - What sockets are in use?

 - What users, admins, and groups exist on the system?

 - Who is current logged in? What users recently logged in?

 - What password policies, if any, are enforced on the host?

 - Is the host joined to an Active Directory domain?

 - What types of interesting information can we find in history, log, and backup files

 - Which files have been modified recently and how often? Are there any interesting patterns in file modification that could indicate a cron job in use that we may be able to hijack?

 - Current IP addressing information

 - Anything interesting in the /etc/hosts file?

 - Are there any interesting network connections to other systems in the internal network or even outside the network?

  - What tools are installed on the system that we may be able to take advantage of? (Netcat, Perl, Python, Ruby, Nmap, tcpdump, gcc, etc.)

  - Can we access the bash_history file for any users and can we uncover any thing interesting from their recorded command line history such as passwords?

  - Are any Cron jobs running on the system that we may be able to hijack?

## checking for the internals
 1. Network Interfaces
pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ ip a

 2. Hosts
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts

 3. User's Last Login
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ lastlog

 4. for the people who are loggin in at this time: who, finger, w




 5. Command History
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ history




 6. Finding History Files
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f \( -name *_hist -o -name *_history \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null

 -rw------- 1 htb-student htb-student 387 Nov 27 14:02 /home/htb-student/.bash_history

 7. Checking for SUID binaries
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

 8. Checking for Sticky Bit Files
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null

 9. Checking for World Writable Files
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ find / -perm -o=w -type f 2>/dev/null

 10. Cron
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ ls -la /etc/cron.daily/



 Proc
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ find /proc -name cmdline -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | tr " " "\n"


 **Installed Packages**
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ apt list --installed | tr "/" " " | cut -d" " -f1,3 | sed 's/[0-9]://g' | tee -a installed_pkgs.list



 Sudo Version
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ sudo -V



 Occasionally it can also happen that no direct packages are installed on the system but compiled programs in the form of binaries. These do not require installation and can be executed directly by the system itself.

 Binaries
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ ls -l /bin /usr/bin/ /usr/sbin/

 Proc
 pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ find /proc -name cmdline -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | tr " " "\n"

Installed Packages
apt list --installed | tr "/" " " | cut -d" " -f1,3 | sed 's/[0-9]://g' | tee -a installed_pkgs.list


### Sudo Version
pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ sudo -V


### Binaries: Check for all the binaries installed
pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ ls -l /bin /usr/bin/ /usr/sbin/

### GTFObins
pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(curl -s https://gtfobins.github.io/ | html2text | cut -d" " -f1 | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d');do if grep -q "$i" installed_pkgs.list;then echo "Check GTFO for: $i";fi;done


### Configuration Files
Check for all readable config files
pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f \( -name *.conf -o -name *.config \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null

### Similarly the script files Scripts
pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f -name "*.sh" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "src\|snap\|share" 

### Running Services by User
pratik04dabhi@htb[/htb]$ ps aux | grep root
