## Preventing Misconfiguration
Once we have figured out our environment, the most straightforward strategy to control risk is to lock down the most critical infrastructure and only allow desired behavior. Any communication that is not required by the program should be disabled. This may include things like:

  1. Admin interfaces should be disabled.
  2. Debugging is turned off.
  3. Disable the use of default usernames and passwords.
  4. Set up the server to prevent unauthorized access, directory listing, and other issues.
  5. Run scans and audits regularly to help discover future misconfigurations or missing fixes.
