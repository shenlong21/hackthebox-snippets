# Path abuse

`PATH` is an environment variable that specifies the set of directories where an executable can be located. An account's PATH variable is a set of absolute paths, allowing a user to type a command without specifying the absolute path to the binary. 
For example, a user can type `cat /tmp/test.txt` instead of specifying the absolute path `/bin/cat /tmp/test.txt`. 

We can check the contents of the PATH variable by typing env | grep PATH or echo $PATH.

Adding `.` to a user's PATH adds their current working directory to the list. For example, if we can modify a user's path, we could replace a common binary such as ls with a malicious script such as a reverse shell. If we add . to the path by issuing the command PATH=.:$PATH and then export PATH, we will be able to run binaries located in our current working directory by just typing the name of the file (i.e. just typing ls will call the malicious script named ls in the current working directory instead of the binary located at /bin/ls).


### Path Abuse

```bash
PATH=.:${PATH}
export PATH
echo $PATH

#.:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

In this example, we modify the path to run a simple echo command when the command ls is typed.

### Path Abuse

```bash
touch ls
echo 'echo "PATH ABUSE!!"' > ls
chmod +x ls
```

### Path Abuse

```bash
ls

# PATH ABUSE!!
```
